# A pure JavaScript smooth scroll example

This is adapted from an answer on [StackOverflow](http://stackoverflow.com/a/36929383/123033) and a linked [JSFiddle](https://jsfiddle.net/jd7q25hg/12/) by Michael Whinfrey.

All the other answers used the JQuery functions, but this is for anyone looking for a pure JavaScript solution.
